    "## **1. Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Air pollution is contamination of the environment by any physical, chemical, or biological agent that changes the atmosphere's natural characteristics ([World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1)). Air pollution can cause both short-term and long-term effects. Temporary short-term effects can cause illnesses (i.e., pneumonia, bronchitis), irritation to the throat, eyes or headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Otherwise, long-term effects can endure for years. Long-term health effects of air pollution are illnesses (i.e., heart disease, lung cancer), damage to human nerves, brain, and other organs, and also causing congenital disabilities. Each year almost 2.5 million people die worldwide because of air pollution ([National Geographic](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/air-pollution)).\n",
    "    \n",
    "The Air Quality Index, the concentration of pollutants in the air in a specific place, is accepted as an indicator of air pollution. The higher the AQI value means, the greater the level of air pollution and the more considerable the health concern. Air Quality Index ranks on a scale from 0 to 500 and levels into five categories. Air Quality Index is calculated daily depending on various parameters. One of these parameters is atmospheric particulate matters 2.5 (PM$_{2.5}$), which are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas. 2.5 refers to the diameter of particles which is 2.5 microns or less. Since PM$_{2.5}$ are smaller, PM$_{2.5}$  can be transferred to longer distances. Therefore the level of PM$_{2.5}$ is noteworthy to human health ([Morillas et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652619311400?via%3Dihub)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasting air quality is essential for reducing the damage caused by air pollution to human health. Also, monitoring and forecasting of air quality have become an increasingly popular topic in artificial intelligence (AI) technology ([Zhang, Zeng & Yan, 2021](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-021-12657-8)). By forecasting air quality,  authorities can take precautions and issue early warnings to reduce the impacts of air pollution. Consequently, I aim to build a time series model to forecast the air quality of Boston, the capital and largest city in Massachusetts in the USA, for 2023. "

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>This data is the daily average air quality of Boston Station. The data was downloaded as a CSV file from the Air Quality Historical Data Platform [link](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/register/). I read data from July 2014 to February 2022. This data contains five parameters of the air quality index: PM25, O3, NO2, SO2, and CO.</p>\n",

    "**ii. Weather:** \n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>The weather can significantly impact air quality since different aspects of the weather affect the amounts of ozone and particulates present in a specific area. For example, sunshine, rain, higher temperatures, wind speed, air turbulence, and mixing depths affect pollutant concentrations. Therefore, I gathered the weather data for Boston.</p>\n",

The average of PM$_{2.5}$ in January ($\\overline{x}=45.21$) and February ($\\overline{x}=45.98$) is higher than other months. As expected, there is an increase in the PM$_{2.5}$ level in the last two months of the year. In November ($\\overline{x}=41.08$) and February ($\\overline{x}=42.32$), the average is not as high as in the first two months. There is an increase in July ($\\overline{x}=43.21$). It could be related to the hot temperature. Contrary to this,  Although the air temperature is low in winter, there is no decrease in PM$_{2.5}$ level. There must be another reason for the winter's high-level PM$_{2.5}$. Also, there is a remarkable decrease in average after February (11.7%), March (15.5%), and June (8.6%).</p>\n",

For instance, the average of November is higher than December in 2014 and 2019, but it is vice versa in other years. Also, 2020 and 2021 have the lowest PM$_{2.5}$ values, which could be related to Covid-19 restrictions</p>\n",

However, there are some strong correlations between PM$_{2.5}$ and other variables at the annual and semi-annual levels. For example,  PM$_{2.5}$ has a positive relationship (r > .5) with humidity, gasoline, number of flights, and a negative correlation with temperature and visibility.</p>"
