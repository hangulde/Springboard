    "\n",
    "Air pollution is contamination environment by any physical, chemical, or biological agent that changes the atmosphere's natural characteristics ([World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/health-topics/air-pollution#tab=tab_1)). The Air Quality Index, the concentration of pollutants in the air in a spesific place, is accepted as an indicator of air pollution. The higher the AQI value means, the greater the level of air pollution and the more considerable the health concern.\n",
